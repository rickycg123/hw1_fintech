## History
Irish entrepreneur brothers John and Patrick Collison founded Stripe in 2010, initially using the name /dev/payments. In June 2010, Stripe received seed funding from Y Combinator, a start-up accelerator. In May 2011, Stripe received a $2 million investment from venture capitalists Peter Thiel, Sequoia Capital, and Andreessen Horowitz. In February 2012, Stripe received an $18 million Series A investment, led by Sequoia Capital at a $100 million valuation. Stripe launched publicly in September 2011 after an extensive private beta. Less than a year after its public launch, Stripe received a $20 million Series B investment. In March 2013, Stripe acquired chat and task-management application Kick-off.

In 2016, Stripe was valued at over $9 billion when it raised a $150 million round. In its next funding round in September 2018, Stripe received a $20 billion valuation while raising $245 million.

In 2019, Stripe raised an additional $100 million in a Series E round from investment firm Tiger Global Management, boosting the payment startup's valuation to $22.5 billion.

Stripe was founded in Palo Alto, but moved to San Francisco in 2012. As of 2019, Stripe was operating across four engineering hubs in Seattle, Dublin, San Francisco and Singapore. Stripe has its headquarters in San Francisco's South of Market (SoMa) area, but announced in October 2019 that it would be moving to Oyster Point in the neighboring city of South San Francisco at some point in 2021, becoming the city's biggest tenant.

In September 2019, Stripe raised $250 million in a new funding round to take its enterprise value to $35 billion. In February 2020 Manhattan Venture Research in New York referred to Stripe as “ripe for an initial public offering (IPO)".

## Product and Services

Stripe provides the technical, fraud prevention, and banking infrastructure required to operate online payment systems. As summarized by the San Francisco Chronicle in 2019, Stripe succeeded by distilling the complex, creaking infrastructure of online payments into a handful of lines of code that could be inserted into a client’s website."[1]

### Payment logistics
Stripe provides APIs that web developers can use to integrate payment processing into their websites and mobile applications. In April 2018, the company released anti-fraud tools that run alongside payment APIs to block fraudulent transactions.

In 2018, the company expanded its services to include a billing product for online businesses. The service operates within the Stripe platform, allowing businesses to manage subscription recurring revenue and invoicing.

### Atlas
On February 24, 2016, the company launched the Atlas platform that allows startups to incorporate more easily in the U.S. The platform originally launched as invite-only. In March 2016, Cuba was added to the list of countries covered under the program. Atlas was relaunched with improvements the following year. As of April 2017, Atlas had signed more than 200 international startups. As of March 2019, startups from 120 countries have used Stripe Atlas to start their business.

On April 30, 2018, the company announced an expansion to Atlas. The upgrades to Atlas included the ability to be used to set up Delaware-based limited liability companies.
